# NUtrition Secret
A website help students find food and track energy intaking.

## Tech Stack
ReactJS, Express, Node and MongoDB.


## Proposed Level of Achievement
Artemis.

## Motivation
Nowadays, the notion of keeping fit is prevailing among citizens, especially young adults, in our society. However, we notice that most students choose to dine in school canteens and there is no enough information on the nutrition information of meals offered.
In addition, we often encounter situations when we want to eat a certain food but don’t know where to buy it.
Therefore, we are inspired to design a platform for NUS students, providing menus offered by each canteen, together with the specific nutrition information and calories of various meals.


## Aim
- Make it convenient for students who usually dine in NUS canteens to record and track calorie intake.
- Make it convenient for students to search for menus offered by each canteen.
- Make it convenient for students to check comments for each stall/meal.

## User Stories
We mainly want to serve NUS students and staff, but can also provide service for NUS visitors.

For people who want to use this app, they can choose to register or not. If they register, they can document the food calories they eat. If they don’t register, they can just look through information.

## Scope of Project
// details about web and mobile adjusting

## Features
- Provide nutrition information on on-campus meals
- Provide menus for every canteen
- Record and track everyday food intake
- Open a public comment area for users to leave their comments about the food
- Automatically calculate total calories intake
- Trial mode available for visitors as well(no need to log in, but functionalities would be limited)

## How are we different with similar platforms?
- react-recipe-app https://github.com/Orbital-B612/react-recipe-app

  This app can only use api to show as a search outcome. we plan to add nutrition api and food information collected in NUS canteens.
- food-help https://github.com/Orbital-B612/food-help 

  This app can search restaurants but can't search for concrete food. We plan to add detailed food information.
