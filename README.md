- then run `npm start`
- run `cd frontend` 
- run `npm install` & `npm start`

then you can see it on localhost:3000

## Tech Stack
ReactJS, Express, Node and MongoDB Atlas.


## Proposed Level of Achievement
Artemis.

## Motivation
Nowadays, the notion of keeping fit is prevailing among citizens, especially young adults, in our society. However, we notice that most students choose to dine in school canteens and there is no enough information on the nutrition information of meals offered.
In addition, we often encounter situations when we want to eat a certain food but donâ€™t know where to buy it.
Therefore, we are inspired to design a platform for NUS students, providing menus offered by each canteen, together with the specific nutrition information and calories of various meals.


## Aim
- Make it convenient for students who usually dine in NUS canteens to record and track calorie intake.
- Make it convenient for students to search for menus offered by each canteen.
- Make it convenient for students to check comments for each stall/meal.

## User Stories
We mainly want to serve NUS students and staff, but can also provide service for NUS visitors.
Since it has been observed that people are gradually getting tired of having loads of apps on their phone, our project will be created in the form of a web app.
Being a web app, our project will help potential users get rid of the procedure of downloading the app, helping users significantly save time and avoid troublesome.
Users will have the choice of make their own decision of whether to register for the website or not.
However, without registration and logging in, the function would be limited.(e.g. unable to check their history of calories intake)

## Scope of Project
We focus on a **website** and its **mobile adjusting**.

- Provide online menu for various stalls that can be found on NUS campus
- Provide information of various food for each stall(e.g. price, calories, ingredients, etc)
- Enable the search function with multiple criteria(e.g. by descending price, by descending calories, by location, by special needs)
- Track daily food and calories intake


## Features
- Provide nutrition information on on-campus food
- Provide online menus for every canteen
- Record and track everyday food intake
- Enable the search function with multiple criteria
(e.g. by descending price, by descending calories, by location, by special needs)
- Open a public comment area for users to leave their comments about the food
- Automatically calculate total calories intake
- Trial mode available for visitors as well(no need to log in, but functionalities would be limited)

## How are we different with similar platforms?
- [react-recipe-app](https://github.com/hamza-mirza/react-recipe-app)

  This app can only use api to show as a search outcome. we plan to add nutrition api and food information collected in NUS canteens.
- [food-help](https://github.com/brtsai/food-help)

  This app can search restaurants but can't search for concrete food. We plan to add detailed food information.
